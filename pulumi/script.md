- Started with https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/pkg/azure-native/compute/galleryimage/
- Went up to Compute to find Gallery based on `GalleryName` requirement
- Ok, copied syntax, what is this pulumi.all and .apply?


- inputs and outputs page explains `all()` and `apply()` with lots of text
- hmmm, go back to good ole `console.log()`, inspect object, type, etc.
- now running pulumi up, open  in browser, more visual cue it is doing something
  - in CLI, it's just dot dot dot create... (too subtle?)
- preview took 4 minutes?
